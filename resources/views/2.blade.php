If we make any substantive changes to the Agreement, You must expressly consent to the new terms.</p>
                    <h6>2. Terms of Agreement</h6>
                    <p>2.1 If we determine that Your submission merits a follow-up, You consent to being contacted at the number You provided by Legal Injury Advocates or an attorney, or law firm which may include being contacted by an auto dialer, text message or pre-recorded call. You acknowledge that standard message and data rates apply and that submitting information constitutes your electronic signature for your consent to being contacted and my agreement to the Terms and Conditions. Legal Injury Advocates LLC will not provide your contact information to any unaffiliated third parties.</p>
                    <p>2.2 You agree that submitting information does not establish an attorney client relationship. You consent to the information submitted being reviewed by more than one attorney or law firm. You understand and agree that any information received in follow-up communications is general information for which there will be no charge. You further acknowledge that the law for each state may vary, and therefore, You will not rely upon this information as legal advice. Because Your case may require advice regarding Your state of residence, local counsel may be contacted for referral of this matter.</p>
                    <p>2.3 We may conclude that the information You submit does not meet out criteria for follow-up. We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to determine whether Your submissions merits follow-up.</p>
                    <h6>3. Representations</h6>
                    <p>3.1 You represent and warrant that the information provided by You up is up-to-date, materially accurate, and is sufficient for Us to identify You and contact You.</p>
                    <p>3.2 Each party represents and warrants to the other that it has full right and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform all of its obligations hereunder; that its execution and performance of this Agreement will not breach any agreement between itself and a third party; and that the provisions of this Agreement are binding upon and enforceable against it except as may be limited by applicable United States bankruptcy laws and other laws affecting creditor’s rights.</p>

                    <p>4.1 YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS, DISPUTES OR CONTROVERSIES BETWEEN YOU AND US, ANY AFFILIATED, SUBSIDIARY, OR RELATED COMPANIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT AND CONTRACT CLAIMS, CLAIMS BASED UPON ANY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL STATUTE, LAW, ORDER, ORDINANCE, OR REGULATION, AND THE ISSUE OF ARBITRABILITY, SHALL BE RESOLVED BY THE FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION PROCEDURES SET BELOW. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIMS SHALL BE BROUGHT SOLELY IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND SHALL NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL. ANY CONTROVERSY CONCERNING WHETHER A DISPUTE IS ARBITRABLE SHALL BE DETERMINED BY THE ARBITRATOR AND NOT BY THE COURT. JUDGMENT UPON ANY AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED BY A NEVADA STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. THIS ARBITRATION CONTRACT IS MADE PURSUANT TO A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND ITS INTERPRETATION, APPLICATION, ENFORCEMENT AND PROCEEDINGS HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (“FAA”).</p>

If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute arising from the claim by good faith negotiations to be conducted within the thirty (30)-day period following the written response, either of them may initiate binding arbitration pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth below. •</p>
                    <p>4.2.2 In the event a party elects to proceed with binding arbitration, it shall provide written notice thereof to the other party by registered or certified mail. The arbitration shall be conducted by and arbitration firm, and shall be conducted using the then current arbitration firm’s commercial rules and regulations (except as varied by this agreement). The arbitration shall take place in Utah, Salt Lake City, but may proceed telephonically in the event the total amount of the claim does not exceed $2,500 U.S. dollars (if the claimant so chooses). •</p>
                    <p>4.2.3 Separate and apart from the agreement to arbitrate set forth above, the parties hereby independently waive any right to bring or participate in any class action in any way related to, or arising from, this Agreement.</p>

                    <h6>6. Governing Law</h6>
                    <p>6.1 Our Agreement and Your use of our Site shall be construed, governed by and enforced under the substantive laws of the State of Nevada applicable to parties resident in and contracts made, executed and wholly performed within the State of Nevada.

We also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our site so that we can constantly improve the quality of the services we provide.

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.

                    <p>We do not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information through our website.

Additionally, we share and transfer your personal information only in the ways set forth in this privacy policy. We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.

                    <p>We do not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information through our website. Similarly, because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, we do not condition the participation of a child under 13 in activities on providing personally identifiable information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from someone under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Contact us at the address below if you want us to change or delete any information that we have about you. We will respond to your request to access, update, or delete your information within ten (10) business days.
