<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&nbsp;This Notice is designed to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) and the Nevada Security and Privacy of Personal Information Statute, as amended (the &ldquo;Nevada Act&rdquo;). Any terms defined in the CCPA or the Nevada Act have the same meaning when used in this Notice. Terms defined in both the CCPA and the Nevada Act have the meaning as defined in the CCPA.

    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Indirectly from you. Example: by observing your actions on our website and the links that you click on emails that we send you.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Use of Personal Information</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We may disclose the personal information we gather for the following purposes:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">To meet the purpose for which you disclosed information.</span>
        <ul class="ul1">

    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">To create a personalized website experience for you.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">For testing of research, analysis and product development to improve our website and services.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">As described to you when collecting your personal information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA and/or the Nevada Act</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">In the event that we need to evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held about our website users is among the assets transferred.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We will not collect additional forms of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Distribution of Personal Information</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We may disclose your personal information to a third party for business purposes. When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the reason and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We share your information with these third parties:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Service providers (advertisers, ad networks, content creators and application providers)</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Data accumulators (gathering data from online and offline sources)</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Legal service providers relevant for the information you provide.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sales of Personal Information</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our business model relies on collecting fees for connecting partner providers with those interested in possibly obtaining their services. As such, we transfer personal information as is required to our partner providers to contact and assist you in exchange for monetary compensation. This is the only situation in which we have sold any personal information in the preceding twelve (12) months.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Consumer Choices and Rights</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information, and the Nevada Act provides Nevada consumers with specific rights regarding their personal information. If you fall within either of these groups, this section describes your rights and explains those rights.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our usage of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see&nbsp;Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will disclose to you:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">The types of personal details we acquired about you</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">The types of sources for the personal details we gathered about you</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">The business purpose for the gathering of that personal information</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">The third-party types that we share personal information with</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">The precise pieces of personal information we gathered about you</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">If any personal information was sold for business reasons, there are two separate lists:</span>
        <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Sales, identifying personal information types that each type of recipient purchased</span></li>
            <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Disclosures for a commercial purpose, identifying the personal details that each recipient acquired.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Removal Request Rights</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have right to request removal of any personal details that we collected and retained. Request is subject to certain exceptions:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Once your request is received and verifiable consumer request is confirmed, we will remove the personal details from our records unless there is an exception that would deny request for removal.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Exceptions:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide product or services requested by you, take actions reasonably foreseen within the bounds of our ongoing relationship with you, or otherwise fulfill our contract with you.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activities, or prosecute perpetrators of those activities.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Debug products and fix errors that impair intended functionality.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Exercise free speech and ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided by law.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1546 seq.).</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information&rsquo;s removal may render impossible or seriously impair the research&rsquo;s goal, if you previously provided informed consent.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Enable only internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Comply with a legal obligation.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make other internal and lawful uses of information that are compatible with the purpose you provided it for.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Removal Rights</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&bull; Calling us at: (866) 210-2410</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">&bull; Emailing us at: <a href="mailto:info@legalinjurynetwork.com"><span class="s5">info@legalinjurynetwork.com</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Only you, or an authorized person registered with the relevant state&rsquo;s Secretary of State may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal details. Although we never intentionally collect information in regard to minors, you may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You may only submit a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&bull; Provide relevant information that allows us to verify you are the person we collected personal information about or an authorized representative.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&bull; Describe your request with &ldquo;relevant detail&rdquo; that allows us to fully understand, evaluate, and respond to it properly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority acting on your behalf to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. For each type of request, &ldquo;sufficient relevant&rdquo; involves:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s6"><strong>Access Request</strong></span><span class="s1">: Please submit a description of the injury or claim under which you originally sought our services and the original telephone number associated with your application.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s6"><strong>Data Portability Request</strong></span><span class="s1">: Please submit the injury or claim under which you originally sought our services, the original telephone number, and your original zip code you submitted to us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s6"><strong>Removal Requests</strong></span><span class="s1">: Please submit the details required for Data Portability Requests. We will contact you for confirmation that you would like to remove your data once we receive your original removal request. We will deny your request if we do not receive such confirmation in the timeframe presented in our confirmation communication efforts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Making a verifiable request does not require you to create an account with us, though we are not likely to gather any personal information unless you have created one in the past. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable request to verify the requestor&rsquo;s identity or authority to make the request.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Response Timing and Format</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We strive to respond to a verifiable request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require additional time, (up to an additional 90 days if you are a California resident, or an additional 45 days if you are a Nevada consumer), we will notify you of the reason and extension period in writing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For anything we disclose, we will only cover the 12-month period prior to the verifiable request&rsquo;s receipt. If applicable, our response will also explain the reasons we cannot fulfill a request. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transfer said information from one entity to another.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or unfounded. If we determine the request justifies a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As you navigate our website, we may use data collection technology to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are older than 16 years of age, you have the right to direct us to not sell any form of personal information ever (the &ldquo;Right to Opt-Out&rdquo;). We never intentionally collect information from users that we undoubtedly know is under 16 years of age and will never sell the personal information of users we know are under 16 years of age. Users who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To exercise the Right to Opt-Out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by sending an email to us at <a href="mailto:info@legalinjurynetwork.com"><span class="s5">info@legalinjurynetwork.com</span></a> with the subject line &ldquo;Opt-Out Request.&rdquo; Please provide the same information as is required for a &ldquo;Access Request&rdquo; as is described above (along with any documentation showing that you are the registered agent of the data subject, if relevant) so we can verify that you are authorized to submit the request.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once you submit a request to opt-out, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into personal information sales at any time. You do so by contacting us at the email address or phone number provided in this document.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your Right to Opt-Out. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Non-Discrimination</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA or the Nevada Act, as applicable, we will not:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Deny you products or services.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Charge you different prices or rates for products or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or penalties.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, if the service that we provide you requires we share certain information about you with partner providers, please note that we cannot continue to provide that service after we receive a valid opt-out request concerning information required to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other California Privacy Rights</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">California&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shine the Light&rdquo; law (Civil Code Section &sect; 1798.83) permits users of our website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties marketing purposes.
