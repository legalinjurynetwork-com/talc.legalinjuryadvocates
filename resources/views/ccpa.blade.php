        <p>This Privacy Notice for <strong>California Residents and Nevada Consumers</strong> supplements and is expressly made part of the information contained in Justice Advocates’ (“Us,” “We,” “Our,” or “Justice Advocates”) <a href="https://legalinjuryadvocates.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who are California residents or consumers in the State of Nevada (“Consumers” or “You”). We adopt this Notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) and the Nevada Security and Privacy of Personal Information Statute, as amended (the “Nevada Act”).  Any terms defined in the CCPA or the Nevada Act have the same meaning when used in this Notice. Terms defined in both the CCPA and the Nevada Act shall have the meaning defined in the CCPA. Unless specifically prevented from doing so by law or otherwise noted, we provide the same rights and information to Nevada consumers as we do California residents.</p>

        <p>Personal information does not include:</p>
        <p>•	Publicly available information from government records.</p>
        <p>•	Deidentified or aggregated consumer information.</p>
        <p>•	Information excluded from the CCPA’s and the Nevada Act’s scope, like: </p>
        <p> a. health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or clinical trial data;</p>
        <p> b. personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FRCA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994.</p>
        <p>We obtain the categories of personal information listed above from the following categories of sources:</p>
        <p>•	Directly from you. For example, from forms you complete when you register on our website or when you email us.</p>
        <p>•	Indirectly from you. For example, from observing your actions on our website and the links that you click on emails that we send you.</p>

        <h5>Use of Personal Information</h5>

        <p>We may use or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the following business purposes:</p>
        <p>•	To fulfill or meet the reason you provided the information. For example, if you provide your personal information to obtain legal services for a specific injury, we will use that information to match you to such appropriate legal services and to refine our processes to more effectively provide services to you in the future.</p>
        <p>•	To assist our partners in fulfilling or meeting the reason you provided the information. For example, if you provide your personal information to obtain legal services for a specific injury, we will transfer that information to a partner provider of such appropriate legal services so they may contact and assist you.</p>
        <p>•	To recognize you when you return to our website.</p>
        <p>•	To store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our website according to your individual interests.</p>
        <p>•	To provide, develop, and support our website and our services.</p>
        <p>•	To create, maintain, customize, and secure your account with us.</p>
        <p>•	To personalize your experience on our website and to deliver content and product and service offerings relevant to your interests.</p>
        <p>•	To help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our website, products and services, databases and other technology assets, and business.</p>
        <p>•	For testing, research, analysis, and product development, including to develop and improve our website and our services.</p>
        <p>•	To estimate our audience size and usage patterns.</p>
        <p>•	To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.</p>
        <p>•	As described to you when collecting your personal information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA and/or the Nevada Act.</p>
        <p>•	In the event that we need to evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held about our website users is among the assets transferred.</p>
        <p>We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.</p>

        <h5>Sharing Personal Information</h5>

        <p>We may disclose your personal information to a third party for a business purpose. When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.</p>

        <p>We share your personal information with the following categories of third parties:</p>
        <p>•	Service providers (advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers and application providers).</p>
        <p>•	Data aggregators (collecting data from both online and offline sources).</p>
        <p>•	“Partner providers” relevant to the services for which you provide your information (legal service providers).</p>

        <p><em>Disclosures of Personal Information for a Business Purpose</em></p>

        <p>In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information for a business purpose:</p>
        <p>Category A: Identifiers.</p>
        <p>Category B: California Customer Records personal information categories.</p>
        <p>Category F: Internet or other similar network activity.</p>
        <p>We disclose your personal information for a business purpose to the following categories of third parties (as described above):</p>
        <p>•	Service providers.</p>
        <p>•	Data aggregators</p>
        <p>•	Partner providers</p>
        <p><em>Sales of Personal Information</em></p>
        <p>Our business model relies on collecting fees for connecting partner providers with those interested in possibly obtaining their services. As such, we transfer personal information as is required for our partner providers to contact and assist you in exchange for monetary compensation. However, this is the only context in which we have sold any personal information in the preceding twelve (12) months.</p>

        <h5>Your Rights and Choices</h5>

        <p>The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information, and the Nevada Act provides Nevada consumers with specific rights regarding their personal information. If you fall within either of these groups, this section describes your rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
        <p><em>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</em></p>
        <p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em>), we will disclose to you:</p>
        <p>•	The categories of personal information we collected about you.</p>
        <p>•	The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</p>
        <p>•	Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</p>
        <p>•	The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</p>
        <p>•	The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</p>
        <p>•	If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing: </p>
        <p>  a. sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and</p>
        <p>  b. disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</p>

        <p><em>Deletion Request Rights</em></p>
        <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em>), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
        <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>
        <p>1.	Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
            2.	Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
            3.	Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
            4.	Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
            5.	Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).
            6.	Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
            7.	Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
            8.	Comply with a legal obligation.
            9.	Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

        <p><em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em></p>
        <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>
        <p>•	Calling us at , or</p>
        <p>•	Emailing us at
        <p>Only you, or a person registered with the relevant state’s Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. Although we never intentionally collect information regarding minors, you may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>

        <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
        <p>•	Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</p>
        <p>•	Describe your request with “sufficient detail” that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</p>
        <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. For each type of request, “sufficient detail” involves:</p>

        <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Access Request</span> – Please submit 1) a description of the injury or claim under which you originally sought our services, and 2) the corresponding telephone number associated with your application (as originally given to us). </p>
        <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Data Portability Request</span> – Please submit 1) the injury or claim under which you originally sought our services, 2) the corresponding telephone number (as originally given to us), and 3) your zip code (as originally given to us).</p>
        <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deletion Requests</span> – Please submit the details required for Data Portability Requests. Additionally, we will contact you for a confirmation response that you would like to delete your data once we receive your original deletion request. We will deny your request if we do not receive such confirmation response within the timeframe described in that confirmation solicitation.</p>
        <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, though we are unlikely to have collected any personal information unless you have created one in the past. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
        <p>For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.</p>

        <p><em>Response Timing and Format</em></p>
        <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to an additional 90 days if you are a California resident, or an additional 45 days if you are a Nevada consumer), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
        <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
        <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

        <h5>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</h5>

        <p>As you navigate through and interact with our Site, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including:</p>

        <p>If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “Right to Opt-Out”). We never intentionally collect information from users that we actually know are less than 16 years of age, and will never sell the personal information of users we actually know are less than 16 years of age. Users who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.</p>
        <p>To exercise the Right to Opt-Out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by sending an email to us at <a href="mailto:info@legalinjuryadvocates.com">info@legalinjuryadvocates.com</a> with the subject line “Opt-Out Request.” Please provide the same information as is required for a “Access Request” as is described above (along with any documentation showing that you are the registered agent of the data subject, if relevant) so we may verify that you are qualified to make the request.</p>
        <p>Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by contacting us at the email address or phone number provided in this notice.</p>
        <p>You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your Right to Opt-Out.  We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>

        <h5>Non-Discrimination</h5>

        <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA or the Nevada Act, as applicable, we will not:</p>
        <p>•	Deny you goods or services.</p>
        <p>•	Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</p>
        <p>•	Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>
        <p>•	Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>
        <p>However, if the service that we provide you requires we share certain information about you with partner providers, please note that we cannot continue to provide that service after we receive a valid opt-out request concerning information required to do so. </p>

        <h5>Other California Privacy Rights</h5>

        <p>California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Nevada consumers have the same right under the Nevada Act. To make such a request, please send an email to <a href="mailto:info@legalinjuryadvocates.com">info@legalinjuryadvocates.com</a>.</p>

        <h5>Changes to Our Privacy Notice</h5>

We will post the updated Notice on the website and update the Notice’s effective date. <strong>Your continued use of our website following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes</strong>.</p>
